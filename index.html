        <div class="subheading mb-5">Spanish Literature üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> Multitasker, collaborative, and enjoys hands on projects who is currently a college student at University of California Riverside. With an undergraduate degree on the works for Spanish Literature and a minor in Political Science, she is thriving for equality in all aspects of work and in society. She is implementing this idea in her early interactions with people as she enjoys working with others and gets inspired by other people's creativity and input in a certain project. Patience is key when executing group work and that is one of her strongest characteristics that she can use in her work environment. And, she is open to hear opinions and judgment for the better good of everyone.   <br><br>

        Spanish has played an important role in her life. Not only was it the first language she was taught by her parents but it was the first one she mastered at a young age. This allowed her to communicate with her parents. Coming from a Spanish-speaking family who did not understand a single word in English, mastering English was not only difficult for her but it was a journey they all went through together. This sparked her independence since she was not able to get full support from her family, and she had to find her own learning techniques. Although she mastered English, she did not stop speaking Spanish nor did it prevent her from communicating with her family. She saw English as a useful tool as she began utilizing this tool to translate letters and news to her parents. This tactic allowed both her and her parents to have an interaction in society and not hide behind the shadows. Ultimately, this notion of helping others who might be experiencing the same struggles influenced her to pursue her career in the Spanish field<br><br>

        Independence has been key throughout her entire life. It has taught her that if one wants something in life they must go after it and not be afraid of rejection and failure. Rejection and failure seems to be every person's biggest fear; however, it blossoms us to be and become better. We must learn from our lessons and keep the race going. Throughout her encounter with society, independence and confidence is everyones biggest possesion. It has become extremely powerful in this new chapter in her life, college. She is integrating this notion into her studies and excecuting it in her everyday college life.<br><br>
        
        Throughout her academic years in elementary, secondary school, and high school she has always contributed in community projects. For instance, in her last year in middle school she petitioned for a graduation ceremony. It required up to 500 signatures and letters to the district in order to let this pettition to go through. She gave out speeches and promoted her mini-campaign in less than 2 months. After several signatures, presentations, and support from everyone, the petittion was approved. In present day, it marks the 6th annual graduation ceremony. She showed citizenship and was awarded a leadership award. This award was never given in Giano but it has become an official award. This caused a huge impact within the community as it arose leadership and hope most of all. She was widely recognized for this huge accomplish that started off with just signing papers. <br><br>
        
        As she progressed into high school, she was able to apply her previous engagements and accomplishments in this new environment. Not only was she placed in Honor courses but was also involved in extracurricular activities. She came across the Herencia Latina Club and this was the spark of what she is now focusing on in University of California Riverside. Apart from that, she was also in the dance team and was the captain for two consecutive years, which was the time she was active in the team. Her leadership skills were being executed as well. Transitioning into the last big two years of high school, there was a radical change. She was accepted into the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. It is one of the most rigorous programs offered in high school and this challenged several aspects of her. There were several ups and downs and a lot of homework. In this case she was not able to use her leadership skills; however, this developed several new abilities. Multi-tasking and working under pressure was one of them. There were several nights without sleep or went to school with only 2 hours of sleep. It exposed her, also, to different working techniques such as: research and excuting labs. She now is able to use this in her college career. Not only with the work load but also in the clasroom environment. Writing a 7 page paper was not a surprise or a problem, rather it was a piece of cake. She faced a lot of rejection and judgment but this helped grow in every aspect. Now, she is more than prepared with what the futre aholds. Rejection and failure is not a fear but rather a fine line that determines her whether it is good or bad.<br><br>
        
        I want to pursue into teaching Spanish and I have done some exploration in regards to my career. Based on the assessments I have taken a crucial necessary skill for this career that has is essential is being social, capable of helping others. Based on the Work Interest Assessment, I got Social of The Helpers which states ‚ÄúEnjoying teaching, caring for others, volunteering, mediating disputes, meeting new people, and working in groups. Highly verbal, express themselves well, and get along well in groups. Describe themselves cooperative, friendly, and understanding‚Äù (Focus2). These are some of the essential skills one needs to be a teacher and knowing that Social is one of my strengths it really fits with my career in pursuing into teaching Spanish. Also, in my Personality Assessment that I received was ‚ÄúYou are caring and understanding of the needs of other people. You enjoy working with people who share your values prefer to work on projects that make a contribution to the well being of other people. Your personal values play an important role in your decisions and you want to get a real sense of purpose from your work. You are action oriented and try to help other people in a practical way. Your approach to work is to be flexible and to keep your options open‚Äù (Focus2).  Although these apply to my Spanish major than the other career I have in mind Political Science there are some connections between them but some of them are weaknesses to Political Science. For instance, my strengths in my Personality Types do not really correlate with Political Science because this career requires fast acting people that can make decisions under pressure which is one of my weaknesses. Also with the career of Political Science there are other factors that do not enable me to fulfill this course but although they do not I can always reach out to programs or expose myself to new materials. On the other hand, some ideas that I have in mind for both careers that will help me build myself is study abroad and internships. These will allow me to gain knowledge and have a better understanding of how it is to work under these careers. For Spanish, I plan to go to study abroad in my third year.<br><br> 

        In contrast to my academic and professional life, I enjoy dancing, singing, traveling, and reading. I consider myslef a catholic and have strong connections with my faith and religion. I feel these are what has kept me grounded and sane throughout everything. It was my armour during my dark days and what has inspired me in my academic choices. As mentioned before, I had to depend on myself and find out solutions for myself. I was not forced into this religion, rather I went out in the lookout because I felt like I needed support from someone else rather than my own family. I did not want to stress my parents by all of the difficulties I was facing nor be a burden.<br><br>
